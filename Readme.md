# Doing Dancing 

This is the source code for software system behind Rhiannon Newton's “Doing Dancing”.

## About the project:

> “…She was one being one. She was one having been that one. She was one going on being that one. She was one being one. She was one being of one kind of a one. She was one being that kind of a one. She was one being another kind of a one. She was one being another kind of a one. She was one being another kind of a one…” —*Orta or One Dancing* by Gertrude Stein

“Doing Dancing” is a solo project that involves re-iterating acts of dancing and reading in relation to Gertrude Stein’s textual portrait of Isadora Duncan ‘Orta or One Dancing’. Imagined as durational ceremony for dance, the ‘Doing Dancing’ deals with extended performative processes of accumulation and erasure, the pluralised lineages encapsulated in any single body and the radical nature of the dancing bodies’ capacity to ‘become other’, or ‘perform many’. Rhiannon collaborates with visual artist Benjamin Forster to develop a live process of digitally archiving the act of doing dancing in accumulative documents that further manifest the inevitable erasure of the performed event.

## Running the code:

Doing Dancing is written using [Cinder](https://libcinder.org). To run this code, first download cinder v0.9 or greater. Then configure the xcode project to point the cinder library.

This code also depends on the Canon EDSDK framework for capturing live video from a Canon SLR camera. You will need to contact canon inorder to get access to this framework.

I have only tested this code on OSX, it may not run on other operating systems.
